# Tennis-Scoreboard
This is a fully functional tennis score-keeping tool, for a single match at a time. The main scoreboard component (rectangle) is to be displayed to the audience, while the controls are used by the Umpire (or TV editor) to update the board.
After adding the player information and starting a new game, updating the score is very simple: Just press one of the 2 "point" buttons, depending on which player won the rally. There is no need for any inputs in terms of when a game/set/match is over, which player is serving next, deuces, tie breaks (whether it's on sets 1-4 or set 5) etc.. The tool is keeping track of all this in the background.
