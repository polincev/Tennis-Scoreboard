				<h1>Tennis Scoreboard</h1>
				<p>
					This is a fully functional tennis score-keeping tool, for a single
					match at a time. The main scoreboard component (rectangle) is to be
					displayed to the audience, while the controls are used by the Umpire
					(or TV editor) to update the board.
				</p>
				<p>
					After adding the player information and starting a new game, updating
					the score is very simple: Just press one of the 2 "point" buttons,
					depending on which player won the rally. There is no need for any
					inputs in terms of when a game/set/match is over, which player is
					serving next, deuces, tie breaks (whether it's on sets 1-4 or set 5)
					etc.. The tool is keeping track of all this in the background.

					It served as a simple exercise for getting familiarized with the 3
					core Web development tools (HTML, CSS, JS).
